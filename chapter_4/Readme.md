#### Study Drills


1. The error shows that on line 14, there is a variable or method (_carpool_capacity_) that the terminal does not recognize. The reason is that the author forgot to create the variable _carpool_capacity_ above, and assign it a value.

2. No it is not necessary, because when talking about people and how many can fit in a car, only whole numbers can be used. If it's just 4, the value for _carpool_capacity_ would be 120 instead of 120.0
