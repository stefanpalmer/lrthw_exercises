_Notes_ : 
   
   * Rubocop complained about the double quoted strings. In order to fix this, I replaced the double quotes with single quotes.
   
   * Double quotes are necessary on line 6 because there are special symbols - single quotes and apostrophes - in the sentence. It's important to distinguish these symbols from the quotes telling **puts** what should be printed in the terminal.
