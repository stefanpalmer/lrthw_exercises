# Questions:

1. _What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know? Please explain these three skills in your own words._
  * __Reading and writing__ - Must be able to type. Can’t learn how to code, or can’t even write code without knowing how to type.
  * __Attention to detail__ - Just a small mistake can make the code completely different, or make it not work at all. 
  * __Spotting differences__ - Details are important in coding and it’s essential to be able to spot even the small differences between two or more pieces of code.

2. _Why do you need to not copy and paste?_
   I won’t be able to learn how to program just by observing and copying & pasting lines of code. The only way I will learn effectively is if I use my fingers to type and my brain to think. Practice and repetition are essential.

3. _Why is Practice and Persistence important?_
   At first programming seems very confusing and it just simply won’t make sense. It will be important for me to keep trying and not get discouraged, until I reach the BANG moment. According to the author, one day my brain will make sense out of all this input and it will understand how programming works. Until that day, I will have to be persistent and keep practicing a lot.
